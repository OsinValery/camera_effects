# camera_effects
Обрабатывает нейросетью картинку с камеры

python folder contains tensor flow test network for style transfer, this net does not work yet
style_transfer_app contains copy of app from library documentation. I rewrote it to make it work
files_from_camera - app for test conception. 
The best result is 1/5 second delay for picture and 10 fps video

second_library - test for second lib, copied from github
